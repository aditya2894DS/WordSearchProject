## Description

An understanding of vocabulary terms is critical for
understanding the overall concepts of texts, communicating ideas and avoiding
misunderstandings. Specifically teaching vocabulary helps to deepen the meaning of texts.

Poor vocabulary knowledge of students is a matter of serious
concern and their quest for finding suitable way to improve vocabulary knowledge is
getting more intense.The vocabulary journal is a kind of personal dictionary;
learners record the words they encounter, along with their meanings and any other
important aspects. Based on the previous studies, it has been
frequently suggested that vocabulary journals are recommended as effective tools for
students to use to take charge of, organize and manage their vocabulary learning

Word search is an online vocabulary journal which allows you to:
<ul>
    <li>Save a word in the database</li>
    <li>View all the words in the database</li>
<ul>
